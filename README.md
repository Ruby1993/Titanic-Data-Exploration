## Titanic-Data-Exploration

### Project Overview
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this project, I will complete the analysis of what kind of people were likely to survive, especially their relevant characteristics.

### Process
The porject inlcudes process below,

1. Data Wrangling

- Data Type Examination
- Missing Value

2. Data Exploration

- Distribution Exploration
- Correlation Exploration

3. Data Analysis

- Age & Survival
- Class Distribution & Survival
- Embark location & Survival
- Gender & Survival
- Two dimensional Analysis
  Gender| Class & Survival

### Conclusion

1. Age & Survivals
For the survived people group, they have more people in the middle ages (from 20-40) and less teenager and children (from 0-20) compared with the died people group.

For the died people group, they have more seniors in the outliers, but its average age is lower than that in the survived people group.

**Conclusion**: People in the middle ages have a higher survival rate.

2. Class & Survivals
More people survived in the first and second class, and less people survived in the third class.
People in the first class are much elder compared to the people in the other class.

**Conclusion**: People in the first class of Titanix has bigger survival chance.

3. Gender & Survivals
Women got higher survival chances in Titanic shipwreck, especially the women in the first class.
Female in the low class got 50% chance to survive.
Male were hardly to survive in that Titanic sinking, especially in the low class.

**Conclusion**: Female, especially the women in the high class had a higher survival chance.
